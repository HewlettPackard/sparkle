by modifying the log4j.properties file on this test suite directory, we can control the level of logging that 
we need for SHM shuffle.

NOTE that the log4j.properties have the copy of the generic Apache Spark's core runtime turned on for 
logging.

(1) make sure that the entire spark runtime built will need to be copied to the local maven repository,  that is:
    .m2/repository/org/apache/spark/spark-hplabs/1.2.0/spark-hplabs-1.2.0.jar

(2) then the command to issue the test is:
    ./runtests.sh org.apache.spark.shuffle.shm.TestShmShuffleOperations
    or:
    ./runtests.sh org.apache.spark.shuffle.shm.TestShmShuffleMultiThreadedOperations
