by modifying the log4j.properties file on this test suite directory, we can control the level of logging that 
we need for SHM shuffle.

NOTE that the log4j.properties have the copy of the generic Apache Spark's core runtime turned on for 
logging.

to measure performance, we need numa binding, for example:

numactl --membind=7 --physcpubind=70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79 ./runtests_all.sh
