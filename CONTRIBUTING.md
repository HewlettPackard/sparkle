# Contributing

You are invited to contribute new features, fixes, or updates, large or small; we welcome pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as we can. However, _please be patient if it takes some time for us to respond to issues and pull requests_.

We strive to maintain a stable version in the master branch, and try new ideas, apply large fixes, or add enhancements in one or more development branches. While you're welcome to submit pull requests against any branch, it is simpler to use an appropriate development branch for new contributions.

Before you start to code, we recommend discussing your plans using a GitHub issue, especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give you feedback on your design, and help you find out if someone else is working on the same thing. If you want to raise an issue such as a defect or an enhancement request, please open a GitHub issue for the appropriate project. Please keep the following in mind:

* If we can't reproduce the issue, we can't fix it. Please detail your environment, and the steps needed to reproduce the issue.
* Try to reduce your code to the bare minimum needed to reproduce the issue.
* If possible, include a suggested fix.
    
# Submitting code pull requests

To make a pull request you will need a GitHub account. For help, see [GitHub's flow documentation](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) on forking and pull requests.

All pull requests with code should include tests that validate your change. If your pull request is not accepted at first, please try again after addressing the feedback you received. The project requires that each pull request must be reviewed by at least one other reviewer before being accepted.
